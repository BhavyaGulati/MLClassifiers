# MLClassifiers - Supervised Learning
Given a set of emails, written by 2 users, objective is to classify the emails as written by one person or the other based only on the text of the email.

## Naive Bayes:
Acuuracy came out to be 0.97 
Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods. The decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each distribution can be independently estimated as a one dimensional distribution. This in turn helps to alleviate problems stemming from the curse of dimensionality.

Particularly here, Naive bayes does work really well with Text. But with phrases which have multiple words which join to form a differrent meaning might not be best implemented by naive bayes.
